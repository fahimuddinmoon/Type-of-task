#  <h2>Short Description</h2>
This project is a task management application where users can add tasks, categorize them into three categories: To-Do, In Progress, and Done. Initially, tasks are added to the To-Do category. Users can move tasks to In Progress by clicking a button and then mark them as Done when completed. Only authenticated users can add, view, update, and delete their own tasks. Unauthorized users cannot access any tasks.
